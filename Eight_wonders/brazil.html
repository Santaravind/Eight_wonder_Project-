        <section><h2> Historical Background:</h2>
            <p>
                The idea for a religious monument on Corcovado was proposed in the 1850s by a Catholic priest named Pedro Maria Boss. However, the actual realization of Christ the Redeemer took place much later. In the early 20th century, as Brazil transitioned from monarchy to republic, there was a growing desire for a symbol that could unify the nation. The idea of a grand statue atop Corcovado gained traction.</p>
